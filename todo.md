# TODO
## Back end
1. change vagrantfile to new standard

4. use FOSUSerBundle instead of google identity

7. make endpoints return flat entities

## Front end
1. update deps, esp. react
2. convert classes to hooks
3. use flat data storage in redux

5. make models use XXProperty type structure
6. update styling via styled components to be a little more bootstrap-like
